# GitHub Security Policy

Software security researchers are increasingly engaging with Internet companies to hunt down vulnerabilities. Our bounty program gives a tip of the hat to these researchers and provides rewards of $1,000 or more for critical vulnerabilities.

If youâ€™ve found a vulnerability, [submit it here](https://github.com/Papayaone/#submit it here).

You can find useful information in our [rules](https://github.com/Papayaone), [scope](https://github.com/Papayaone/#scope), [escope ](https://github.com/Papayaone/#scope) and [FAQ](https://github.com/Papayaone/#faqs).
